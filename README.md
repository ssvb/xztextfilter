# xztextfilter
A preprocessing filter for improving LZMA compression of non-English UTF-8 texts. Intended to be contributed to XZ Utils after it's ready and stable: https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/50

## Test implementations

### proto1

This is a stdin to stdout convertor. Hastily written and almost untested. May contain bugs. Exists just to get started
and provide some sort of baseline to compare against.

## license

It's MIT licensed in this particular repository. But the official XZ Utils project maintainers (https://tukaani.org/xz/)
are allowed to take any parts of this code and relicense it as public domain within their git repository. So the path to
public domain is via the https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz repository.
